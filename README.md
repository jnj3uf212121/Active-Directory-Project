**Educational Network Infrastructure Deployment: A Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 Integration Project**

**Introduction:**
I spearheaded the creation and configuration of a school network topology, utilizing Windows Server 2019 for server roles and Windows 10 Enterprise for client testing. I established a domain controller, DHCP server, and file server to manage domain operations, dynamic IP allocation, and centralized resource sharing within the educational environment.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Project Coordination:** Personally ensured alignment with organizational objectives and educational requirements through meticulous planning and execution.
- **Infrastructure Management:** Single-handedly oversaw deployment and configuration of essential network components, including the domain controller, DHCP server, and file server.
- **Testing and Troubleshooting:** Conducted comprehensive testing and troubleshooting to validate network functionality and promptly resolve technical issues.
- **User Training and Support:** Provided training and support to end-users for seamless integration and utilization of network services.
- **Documentation:** Documented project milestones, configurations, and best practices for knowledge sharing and future reference.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Secure Domain Deployment:** Successfully deployed a secure domain for efficient network management.
- **DHCP Configuration:** Overcame initial configuration challenges to configure DHCP server for dynamic IP address allocation.
- **Centralized Resource Access:** Established a file server for centralized access to educational resources.
- **User Account Testing:** Conducted thorough testing of user accounts and access permissions using a Windows 10 Enterprise client machine.
- **Security Implementation:** Implemented Group Policy for enhanced security and access control across the network.

**Technologies Used:**
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller, DHCP Server, File Server)
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Hyper-V for virtualization
- Active Directory
- DHCP services
- File services

**Project Setup and Configuration:**
I orchestrated the setup and configuration of key network components, including the Domain Controller (Thor), DHCP Server (Atlas), File Server (Zeus), and Windows 10 Enterprise Client Machine.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- **DHCP Configuration Challenges:** I addressed IP conflicts by adjusting the allocation range and excluding static IPs.

**Conclusion:**
I successfully established a fully functional school network topology, enhancing operational efficiency and security through real-world user account testing. My work provided valuable insights into network performance and scalability, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

**Future Enhancements:**
I plan to incorporate advanced security features, additional network services such as print servers, and explore scalability options to support network growth.
