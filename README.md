# Educational Network Infrastructure Deployment: A Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 Integration Project

## Introduction:
- Led the creation and configuration of a school network topology utilizing Windows Server 2019 for server roles and Windows 10 Enterprise for client testing.
- Established a domain controller, DHCP server, and file server to manage domain operations, dynamic IP allocation, and centralized resource sharing within the educational environment.

## Responsibilities:
- Project Coordination: Ensured alignment with organizational objectives and educational requirements through meticulous planning and execution.
- Infrastructure Management: Oversaw deployment and configuration of essential network components, including domain controller, DHCP server, and file server.
- Testing and Troubleshooting: Conducted thorough testing and troubleshooting to validate network functionality and promptly resolve technical issues.
- Stakeholder Collaboration: Collaborated with stakeholders to define user requirements and implement access controls and security policies.
- User Training and Support: Provided training and support to end-users for seamless integration and utilization of network services.
- Documentation: Documented project milestones, configurations, and best practices for knowledge sharing and future reference.

## Key Achievements:
- Secure Domain Deployment: Successfully deployed a secure domain for efficient network management.
- DHCP Configuration: Overcame initial configuration challenges to configure DHCP server for dynamic IP address allocation.
- Centralized Resource Access: Established a file server for centralized access to educational resources.
- User Account Testing: Conducted thorough testing of user accounts and access permissions using a Windows 10 Enterprise client machine.
- Security Implementation: Implemented Group Policy for enhanced security and access control across the network.

## Technologies Used:
- Windows Server 2019 (Domain Controller, DHCP Server, File Server)
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- Hyper-V for virtualization
- Active Directory
- DHCP services
- File services

## Project Setup and Configuration:
- Orchestrated the setup and configuration of key network components:
  - Domain Controller: Thor
  - DHCP Server: Atlas
  - File Server: Zeus
  - Windows 10 Enterprise Client Machine

## Challenges and Solutions:
- DHCP Configuration Challenges: Addressed IP conflicts by adjusting allocation range and excluding static IPs.

## Conclusion:
- Successfully established a fully functional school network topology, enhancing operational efficiency and security through real-world user account testing.
- Provided valuable insights into network performance and scalability, laying the groundwork for future enhancements.

### Future Enhancements:
- Plan to incorporate advanced security features, additional network services such as print servers, and explore scalability options to support network growth.
